# This task introduces us with vigenere cipher which is a poly aphabetic cipher which uses a 26x26 
# alphabetic table to encrypt and decrypt the code.
# We were given a intercepted mesage and the cipher text and we were tasked with finding
# the hidden message
# First we decrypt the key using the message and then we use the key to find out the encrypted text
